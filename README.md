Pset 5 - working with APIs-

I've made an application that asks for the users input. 
The input should be a city name (with country initials i.e. US or UK for higher chance for finding the correct city)
The output has been made with an API and a JSON object. 
Credits also go to "openweathermap.org" for helping out with the API's
